         * This is the pattern 1 , in which the size of window is fixed and
         * we have to achieve something like maxsum etc..
         * so what are the steps would be , rather then you know iterate for all subarrays
         * as brute force it would be better if we would be iterating to only k size windows.
         *
         * so steps to do these types of  qns are -
         *
         * Step-1 : Declaration of variables -> l, r, maxsum, etc   --> Declaration Time.
         *
         * Step-2 : Use Loop & Calculate sum in the start -> Always Good Practice.  --> Loop & Sum Time.
         *
         * Step-3 : Now print ans if calculated sum comes in range etc.  --> Ans Printing Time.
         *
         * Step-4 : Move forward -> Shrink and Expand Time.
         *
         *
